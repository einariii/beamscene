# Beam Scene
A collaborative blog built by members of the first [Dockyard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/) cohort, uncovering the under-appreciated people and stories hiding in the very vibrant [BEAM ecosystem](https://github.com/llaisdy/beam_languages#34-languages-on-the-beam). Expect contributions from folks writing Elixir, Erlang, Gleam, Luerl, Clojerl, Alpaca...maybe even Fika! :bullettrain_front:

Written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Phoenix Liveview](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view), [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com/), and [PostgresQL](postgresql.org/). Deployed on the incredible [Fly.io](https://fly.io).
