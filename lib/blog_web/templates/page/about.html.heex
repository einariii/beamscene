        BEAMscene is a collaborative blog built by members of the first <a href="https://github.com/DockYard-Academy">Dockyard Academy</a> cohort.
        Our focus is on the fascinating <a href="https://github.com/llaisdy/beam_languages#34-languages-on-the-beam">family of programming languages</a> that run on <a href="https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/">the BEAM virtual machine</a>,
        each of which presents a unique perspective on the past, present, and future of computingâ€”but all through the lens of the Erlang paradigm.
        <br><br>
        BEAMscene embraces nonconventional approach to reading and thinking with programming. Beyond purely technical discussions, we seek out BEAM languages as they are
        spoken in "the real world." How does a programmer fall in love with high concurrency? Why does an investor trust a company with an all-Elixir stack? Where are teachers
        teaching functional programming through Erlang?
        <br><br>
        With us, uncover the under-appreciated people and stories that sustain by the genius of <a href="https://erlang.org/euc/08/euc_smp.pdf">SMP</a>.
        Expect contributions from folks working in Elixir, Erlang, Gleam, Luerl, Clojerl, Alpaca...maybe even Fika!
